# React Face Recognition App

A simple, production-ready README for a face recognition web app built with *React*. This project demonstrates detecting faces in images (or webcam) using either a client-side library (face-api.js / TensorFlow\.js) or a hosted face-detection API (Clarifai, AWS Rekognition, etc.).

## Project Overview

This app lets users upload an image or use their webcam to detect faces and show bounding boxes (and optionally landmarks/expressions). The UI is built in React. Face detection can run fully in the browser (no server) using *face-api.js* (TensorFlow\.js models), or you can call a server-side/third-party API for detection and recognition.

Use-cases: demo / learning, prototype for attendance/visitor systems, photo apps. This repo is not production-ready for identity verification â€” see Security & Privacy below.

## Features

* Upload image or use webcam stream
* Detect faces and draw bounding boxes
* Optionally show landmarks (eyes, nose, mouth) and expressions
* Support for client-side models (face-api.js/TensorFlow\.js)
* Optional server-based flow (Clarifai / face recognition API)
* Simple responsive UI and configuration
## Tech Stack

* Frontend: React (Create React App or Vite)
* Face detection: *face-api.js* (TensorFlow\.js) or third-party API (Clarifai, AWS Rekognition, Face++...)
* Styling: Tailwind CSS (optional) or plain CSS
* Optional Backend: Node.js + Express for proxy / authentication / persistence

---

## Prerequisites

* Node.js (>= 16 recommended)
* npm or yarn
* If using face-api.js: no API keys required (models are downloaded at runtime)
* If using a third-party service: API key and account access
